Model created to classify questions
q_classify.py was the script to create the model using keras and the dataset from Roth and Li
This script does not need to be run because the model, tokenizer, and encoder have all been saved
Just need to run predict_q_classify with the three files within the directory.
Replace newtext with the new questions to get a prediction of the question type.
The test accuracy is 74.79%
Used raw text to create model without any features.
For future, can create features such as keywords, entities,etc to get better model
